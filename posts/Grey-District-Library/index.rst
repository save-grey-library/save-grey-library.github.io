This website is the work of the Save Grey District Library Working Group. It is not associated with or necessarily endorsed by the Grey District Library or the Grey District Council
It has been established by a group of concerned Grey District ratepayers who are worried about the future of Library Services in the Grey District and the current Council CEO's proposal to remove library management and downgrade the role of qualified librarians.
